time complexity of:

insert() method -(O(n)) lineartime complexity since it goes through each individual bucket until it reaches its desired bucket to add data to.

remove() method -(O(n)) linear time complexity since it goes through each individual bucket untill it reaches its desired bucket to remove its value from

contains() method -(O(n)) linear time complexity because it goes through each individual bucket until it either finds the value in the parameter or it reaches the end.

get() method - (O(n)) constant time complexity because it looks at the specified index to find the value.

operator[] - (O(n)) constant time complexity because it looks at the specifified index to find the value.
